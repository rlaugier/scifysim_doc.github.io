Quick start
-----------

After you have :ref:`installed <setup>` SCIFYsim, you can get taste of SCIFYsim by running the notebook ``SCIFYsim/scifysim/quick_start.ipynb``. This will get you through the initialization of a simulator object and make your first exposures.

What you need to know
---------------------

SCIFYsim does not have a GUI. You will have to interface with it through the API. You our recommendation is to use **jupyter(lab)** to create **semi-interactive scripts** to run the simulations and plot the data. You can also use **scripts** for a more rigid usage.
